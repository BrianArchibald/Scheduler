# Meeting Scheduler

This is a personal project made in 2018 to help learn interactions between the backend and frontend of a project.

The application allows users to easily schedule and manage meetings with others.  Users can set their own calendar availability and meeting details and then send a link to another user to sign up for a meeting.  Both parties then get email notification of the successfully scheduled meeting.

## Getting Started

Simply sign up with an email and password and create your meeting or use the Demo button.
